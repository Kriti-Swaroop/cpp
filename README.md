# CPP

## About

CPP is my collection of small but concise beginner projects whose sole purpose
it is to expose myself to the C++ programming language. In this spirit, nothing
I work on here might be useful to you. On the other hand, if you're looking for
beginner-friendly project ideas feel free to follow along.

1. **Guess** is *Guess the Number* but the user enters a number and lets the comp
guess the number `tags = [cli, random, conditions, recursive function]`
2. **ISBN10** is a project for validating ISBN-10 checksums `tag=[string manipulation, vector, conversion]`
