# CPP

## About

CPP is my collection of small but concise beginner projects whose sole purpose
it is to expose myself to the C++ programming language. In this spirit, nothing
I work on here might be useful to you. On the other hand, if you're looking for
beginner-friendly project ideas feel free to follow along.
